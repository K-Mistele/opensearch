Based on the available information, Naptha AI has raised a total of $6 million in funding, all from a single fundraising event.[^1,2]

### Pre-Seed Funding Round

In October 2024, Naptha AI successfully completed a Pre-Seed funding round, raising $6 million.[^3,4] The announcement date for this round was October 31, 2024.[^4,2] This amount is considered a substantial sum for an initial fundraise, positioning the company at the forefront of AI evolution.[^5]

While most sources classify this as a "Pre-Seed" round, at least one financial data provider, PitchBook, categorizes the deal as a "Seed" round.[^3,1,4]

### Investors

The funding round was co-led by two firms:[^3,4,5]
*   **Arche Capital**: A venture capital firm co-founded by Vanessa Grellet and William Wolf.[^5]
*   **Cyber Fund**: A premier investment firm recognized as the creators of Lido and P2P.org.[^5]

Other prominent investors who participated in the round include:[^3,4,2]
*   GnosisDAO (also listed as Gnosis)[^3,1,4,2,5]
*   Halo Capital[^3,1,4,2,5]
*   MH Ventures[^1,2]
*   Paper Ventures[^2]
*   Polymorphic Capital[^3,4,2,5]
*   Seed Club Ventures, noted as the first investor in Stability AI.[^3,4,5]

**Confidence Level: High**

My confidence in this summary is high. The provided facts are consistent across multiple sources regarding the total funding amount, the specific funding round, the date, and the key investors involved. The information presents a unified account of Naptha AI's sole fundraising event to date. The only minor discrepancy is the "Pre-Seed" versus "Seed" label, which is a common variation in industry reporting.
